# Lab Report: Deliverable 3
Alongside your code submission, provide a report documenting your development process. We are interested in how you approached the problem, the sequence of steps you took to reach a solution, and how you handled the challenges of a dynamic environment.

## 1. Discovery & Methodology
Describe your "Step 0." Before writing the final script, how did you explore the available devices and their capabilities?

How did you use the Thing Description (TD) Directory to understand what actions and properties were available?

What was your process for testing individual components (e.g., moving the arm once, or reading a single sensor) before building the full logic?

## 2. Implementation Process
Walk us through the stages of building your solution.
How did you transition from a basic script to a system that can handle the full sequence (Pick -> Detect -> Light)?

Explain your solution and architecture.
How does your system work? Of which components does it exists and what does each component do?


## 3. Problems Encountered & Troubleshooting
Document the specific hurdles you faced during development.

Identify the top 2 or 3 problems you ran into (e.g. units not matching, or synchronization issues).

For each problem, describe your troubleshooting process: How did you identify the root cause, and what steps did you take to overcome it?

## 4. Adapting to Heterogeneity
Describe how you tackled the "Semantic Heterogeneity".

Explain the logic you implemented to make your solution work across different runs.

If you ran into issues with the randomness, document what happened and how you adjusted your code to be more flexible.

## 5. Discussion
Reflect on the final result. 
If you had to deploy this in a real factory with 50 different types of robots, how would your "discovery" process change? 
What other semantic heterogeneity could you expect to face in an industrial setup and how could you overcome them?

## Submission Details:

Format: PDF (approx. 2–4 pages).

Focus: We value a clear description of your engineering journey—including the mistakes and the fixes—over a perfectly polished final product description.
